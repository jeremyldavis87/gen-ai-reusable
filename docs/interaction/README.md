# Service Interaction Guide

## Overview

This document describes how the various Gen AI Services interact with each other and external systems. It covers communication patterns, data flow, and integration points.

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

1. REST APIs
   - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
   - JSON payloads
   - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Authentication via JWT tokens

2. gRPC
   - High-performance RPC calls
   - Protocol Buffers for data serialization
   - Bi-directional streaming support
   - Service-to-service communication

### Asynchronous Communication

1. Message Queues (SQS)
   - Event-driven processing
   - Decoupled service communication
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Dead letter queues

2. Event Bus (EventBridge)
   - System-wide events
   - Service discovery
   - State changes
   - System notifications

## Service Dependencies

- Output: Standardized formats
- Dependencies: None
- Consumers: All other services

### Classification Service
- Input: Documents
- Output: Classification results
- Dependencies: Format Conversion Service
- Consumers: Workflow Service, Search Service

### Workflow Service
- Input: Classification results
- Output: Workflow states
- Dependencies: Classification Service
- Consumers: UI, External systems

### Search Service
- Input: Classification results
- Output: Search results
- Dependencies: Classification Service
- Consumers: UI, External systems

### Quality Service
- Input: Documents, Classification results
- Output: Quality metrics
- Dependencies: Format Conversion Service, Classification Service
- Consumers: Workflow Service

### Personalization Service
- Input: User data, Document data
- Output: Personalized recommendations
- Dependencies: Classification Service, Search Service
- Consumers: UI

### Document Extraction Service
- Input: Raw documents
- Output: Extracted data
- Dependencies: Format Conversion Service
- Consumers: Classification Service

### Conversational Service
- Input: User queries
- Output: Responses
- Dependencies: Classification Service, Search Service
- Consumers: UI

### Code Service
- Input: Code snippets
- Output: Code analysis
- Dependencies: None
- Consumers: UI

## Data Flow Examples

### Document Processing Flow

1. Document Upload
   ```
   Client -> Format Service -> Classification Service -> Workflow Service
   ```

2. Search Flow
   ```
   Client -> Search Service -> Classification Service -> Format Service
   ```

3. Quality Check Flow
   ```
   Workflow Service -> Quality Service -> Classification Service -> Format Service
   ```

## Integration Points

### External Systems

1. Authentication Service
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect
   - JWT token validation
   - User management

2. Storage Service
   - S3 for document storage
   - RDS for metadata
   - ElastiCache for caching

3. Monitoring Systems
   - CloudWatch for metrics
   - X-Ray for tracing
   - CloudTrail for audit logs

## Error Handling

### Retry Policies

1. Transient Failures
   - Exponential backoff
   - Maximum retry attempts
   - Circuit breaker pattern

2. Permanent Failures
   - Dead letter queues
   - Error notifications
   - Manual intervention

### Error Propagation

1. Service-to-Service
   - Error codes
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces (development only)

2. Client Communication
   - HTTP status codes
   - Error responses
   - Client-friendly messages

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Requirements

1. Critical Paths
   - Document processing: < 5s
   - Search queries: < 2s
   - Classification: < 3s

2. Non-Critical Paths
   - Quality checks: < 10s
   - Personalization: < 5s
   - Analytics: < 15s

### Scaling Patterns

1. Horizontal Scaling
   - Stateless services
   - Load balancing
   - Auto-scaling groups

2. Vertical Scaling
   - Resource-intensive services
   - Database instances
   - Cache clusters

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

1. Service-to-Service
   - Mutual TLS
   - API keys
   - IAM roles

2. Client-to-Service
   - JWT tokens
   - OAuth2
   - API keys

### Authorization

1. Access Control
   - Role-based access
   - Resource-based policies
   - Service-specific permissions

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Data masking

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Observability

1. Metrics
   - Request rates
   - Error rates
   - Latency
   - Resource usage

2. Logging
   - Request/response logs
   - Error logs
   - Audit logs
   - Performance logs

### Tracing

1. Distributed Tracing
   - Request IDs
   - Correlation IDs
   - Span IDs
   - Parent-child relationships

2. Debug Tools
   - Local development
   - Staging environment
   - Production debugging
