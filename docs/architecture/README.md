# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Gen AI Services platform is a microservices-based architecture deployed on AWS. Each service is containerized and can be deployed independently.

### Infrastructure

- **Container Orchestration**: AWS ECS/EKS
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **Load Balancing**: AWS Application Load Balancer
- **Service Discovery**: AWS Service Discovery
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch
- **Logging**: AWS CloudWatch Logs
- **Database**: Amazon RDS
- **Cache**: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)
- **Message Queue**: Amazon SQS
- **Object Storage**: Amazon S3

### Service Architecture

Each service follows a similar architecture pattern:

```
service/
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
├── config/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── services/
└── utils/
```

### Service Communication

- Inter-service communication is handled via REST APIs
- Event-driven communication uses SQS for asynchronous operations
- Service discovery is managed through AWS Service Discovery

### Security

- Authentication: JWT-based authentication
- Authorization: Role-based access control
- Network Security: VPC with private subnets
- Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager
- SSL/TLS: AWS Certificate Manager

### Monitoring and Observability

- Metrics: CloudWatch Metrics
- Logging: CloudWatch Logs
- Tracing: AWS X-Ray
- Alerts: CloudWatch Alarms

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

- Local development using Docker Compose
- Development environment in AWS
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions

### Production Environment

- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Auto-scaling groups for each service
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases

## Data Flow

1. Client requests are routed through the API Gateway
2. Requests are authenticated and authorized
3. Requests are routed to appropriate service
4. Service processes request and interacts with other services as needed
5. Response is returned to client

## Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of services
- Database read replicas
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Queue-based processing for long-running tasks

## Disaster Recovery

- Multi-region deployment
- Automated backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Failover procedures
